# CH32V003

RISC-V2A, 16KB Flash, 2KB SRAM, 48MHz

> **Note**
> CH32V003 is a riscv32ec core, which is not supported by official Rust yet.
> ch32-rs team maintains a fork of Rust at <https://github.com/ch32-rs/rust>.
> You can check [Noxim's Blog](https://noxim.xyz/blog/rust-ch32v003/introduction/) for riscv32ec support.

## Instruction Set

**Important:** As described in the QingKe V2 Processor Manual, the core has custom instruction set extensions

> ... **XW**: 16-bit compression instruction for self-extending byte and half-word operations.
>
> _Note: To further improve code density, extend the XW subset by adding the following compression directives
> c.lbu/c.lhu/c.sb/c.sh/c.lbusp/ c.lhusp/c.sbsp/c.shsp, use based on the MRS compiler or the toolchain it provides._
