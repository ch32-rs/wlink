## Feature Support

- [x] Flash firmware, support Intel HEX, ELF and raw binary format
- [x] Erase chip
- [x] Halt, resume, reset support
- [x] Read chip info
- [x] Read chip memory(flash)
- [x] Read/write chip register - very handy for debugging
- [x] Code-Protect & Code-Unprotect for supported chips
- [x] Enable or Disable 3.3V, 5V output
- [x] [SDI print](https://www.cnblogs.com/liaigu/p/17628184.html) support, requires 2.10+ firmware
- [x] [Serial port watching](https://github.com/ch32-rs/wlink/pull/36) for a smooth development experience
- [x] Windows native driver support, no need to install libusb manually (requires x86 build)

## Tested On

### Probes

Current firmware version: 2.11 (aka. v31).

> **NOTE**: The firmware version is not the same as the version shown by WCH's toolchain. Because WCH calculates the version number by `major * 10 + minor`, so the firmware version 2.10 is actually v30 `0x020a`.

- WCH-Link [CH549] - the first version, reflash required when switching mode
- WCH-LinkE [CH32V305][CH32V307] - the recommended debug probe
- WCH-LinkW [CH32V208][CH32V208] - wireless version
- WCH-Link? [CH32V203][CH32V203]

### MCU

> **Note**
> A common misunderstanding is that the CH32V2 and CH32V3 series has fewer flash! No it's not.
> The CH32V203 series has 224K available flash. The CH32V208 and CH32V30x series has 480K available flash.
> The number in the datasheet is the "zero-wait-state" flash size, which is not the same as the "available" flash size.

## Install

`cargo install --git https://github.com/ch32-rs/wlink` or download a binary from the [Nightly Release page](https://github.com/ch32-rs/wlink/releases/tag/nightly).

> **Note**
> On Linux, you should install libudev and libusb development lib first.
> Like `sudo apt install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev` on Ubuntu.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install [wlink-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wlink-git) via the AUR.

```bash
yay -Syu wlink
```

## Usage

> **Note**
> For help of wire connection for specific chips, please refer to `docs` subdirectory.
